My name is Edbert Geraldy Cangdinata
I have interests in coding, competitive programming, computers, gaming, and weeb shit.
Currently a high school student.

I commonly go by the username `Berted` on several online judges:

- [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/users/Berted)
- [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/users/berted)
- [TLX](https://tlx.toki.id/profiles/Berted)

This blog will mostly be on random problems I find worth writing about.
