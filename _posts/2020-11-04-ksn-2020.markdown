# Preamble

Problemset accesible [here](https://tlx.toki.id/problems/ksn-2020).
No editorial yet.
Impressions: Much harder questions compared to usual.

# Problem 0A - Power Tower

The intended solution is probably some casework, but I was lazy, so I used the "generalized" version of Euler's Theorem, which is explained [here](https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/phi-function.html).

# Problem 0B - Four Squares

This is [Lagrange's Four Square Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange%27s_four-square_theorem). 

All I did was iterate $$a, b, c$$ from the largest possible value, then check if a satisfying $$d$$ exists. Theoretically should be $$O(N^{\frac{3}{2}})$$, but runs fast with the inputs given (or it actually is fast, I can't prove it).

# Problem 0C - Taking Stones

A simplified variant of a modification of NIM game. 

If everyone played optimally, 
then if $(A_1 \pmod N + 1) \oplus  (A_2 \pmod N + 1) \dots (A_K \pmod N + 1) \neq 0$, then the first person who plays would be the winner. Otherwise, it would be the other player. We can construct a winning strategy by maintaining this XOR value. 

It is much easier to implement this for $K = 1$ and $K = 2$.
